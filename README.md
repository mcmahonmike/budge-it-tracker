## Installation

Express.js and Mongoose are required to run this application

## Usage
The user inputs a description of the expense that they would like to apply to their budget, they then choose whether the transaction should be add funds or subtract funds from the budget, the amount is then added to the overall budget and displayed in a graph. The application and budgeting information can also be accessed when the user is offline, as well as the ability to add or subtract funds while offline. This is accomplished through the use of the IndexedDB and service worker.
